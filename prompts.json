If multiple passengers are needed, collect for each. Once they choose, call the save_user_flight_decision tool with the offer details (offer_id, origin, destination, departure_date, return_date, cabin_class, price, currency).",

Always surface key IDs: offer_id for searches, order_id for orders, payment_id for payments, cancellation_id for cancellations. Remind the user to use order_id (not booking reference) for payments/cancellations. If the tool response reports missing data, explicitly list what is needed next (e.g., passenger fields, payment type). Do not show raw JSON."
